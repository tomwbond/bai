# The eulogy I gave at Bai's memorial service in March 2019.

## Introduction and early years

In late summer 1986, in the same way that you try to soften the blow for your dog when you bring a new puppy home from the pet shop, my mum bought a fish tank full of guppy fish and a robot in an effort to distract her pampered firstborn from the second child she was bringing back from the hospital.

As it turns out, she needn’t have worried. I loved my little sister from the first moment I saw her. I was so excited and proud that I would literally bring strangers in from the street to come and see her. 

Her nickname, Bai, also stems from that time. Despite my current command of the English language, I could barely string two words together by the time she was born. At 19 months old, I couldn’t even pronounce her name. The best I could do was Bai. ‘Mah Bai’, to be precise.

The name stuck, at least until she had the chance to rebrand herself among her writing and acting friends.

Of course, those early days were difficult. Bai was born with defects and misalignments right across her heart, which meant her and I spent a lot of time playing on Rose ward at the Royal Brompton hospital in London.

The doctors and nurses there looked after Bai for almost her entire life, but getting admitted wasn’t automatic. Her problems weren’t detected before she was born, and because it was so unusual people assumed nothing was wrong. But she was clearly unwell. 

Eventually, our mum turned to the Yellow Pages to look up a famous paediatrician and turned up at his door. Luckily, he didn’t even let them in: he looked at Bai, recognised the marks on her face and called an ambulance straight away.

Back then, the technology wasn’t advanced enough, so when the surgeons tried to operate to improve Bai’s heart, they determined there wasn’t anything they could realistically do with what they had available. Dr Rigby, who looked after Bai for decades, told our parents to take her home, and give her a childhood.

That was how we ended up in France. Deciding that London’s air pollution was a terrible place for Bai, we set off in a Pontiac TransAm and Land Rover Carawagon and were going to stop wherever the sun came up, which happened to be in the forest surrounding a Trappist monastery, where we spent the summer. 

In the clean, country air, Bai’s health began to pick up. After that, we moved to a farmhouse on the edge of a village where we spent many happy years.

We lived with dogs, cats, chickens, cockatiels, guinea pigs, rabbits, sheep, goats and ponies. Bai was always on the lookout for any animal in need of a home, including the fully grown Pyrenean mountain dog that she found, brought into the house, and hid in the attic.

France was when Bai’s passion for ponies really began, especially the delinquent ones. The ponies at the farm learnt to throw their feed buckets through the kitchen window when they were hungry, and Bai wouldn’t have dreamed of telling them off.

Back in England, the waifs and strays did not abate. One day, a man called Clive came to visit. In the bathroom, he saw the words ‘I want a pony’ scrawled half a dozen times across the mirror in red lipstick. Coming back downstairs, Clive asked “Is your daughter looking for a pony? I have one she can have.”

In a lot of ways, that pony - Shoestring - turned Bai’s health around. He was her constant companion. She’d read Pony Magazine with him in his stable, and learnt how to ride in a way that didn’t need a lot of physical effort - instead using her voice and breathing.

Shoestring was part of a long line of pony friends, and she was never far from the sort of coincidences that brought him to her. Animals just found her, and people got to know about it. Once, someone simply left a pony at the stable door. 

Most of us, faced with a dumped pony, would call the RSPCA. And maybe the police. But Bai? No. She took Bailey in and look after him for the rest of his life.

Bai’s lifelong love of animals made all of us more outdoorsy than we might otherwise have been. There were long walks on horseback heading to somewhere with a view for a picnic with the dogs. Even Rusty, our beloved little Norfolk terrier, learnt to like horses, once the girls started letting him sit in front of them on the saddle.

## Her personality

It was in France that Bai’s intelligence, steely determination and even stubbornness started to become apparent. At school, she didn’t think it was fair that she was in a different class to me, despite being a year and a half younger. In protest, she refused to say a single word - in either language - until she was moved up into my class, at which point it became clear she could already speak French as well as anyone else in the room.

One teacher described her as the perfect diplomat’s wife: warm, polite and dignified, but always, always got her way. She had a wicked sense of humour and loved practical jokes.

I always treated Bai very normally. She never asked for special treatment, and absolutely never wanted to be left out. If anyone was going to pilot a suitcase down two flights of stairs, it was going to be Bai. True story.

Of course, that sort of bravery had real-world applications. She won an electric car race at Goodwood in a car she helped build herself at school. The other girls in the team chose her as the driver and called her their secret weapon because she weighed very little and had not a shred of fear.

We can’t really remember how, but she also won a flight in a microlight. Our mum watched aghast as after all those years trying to keep her alive, Bai hopped in and went swooping around the skies.

She was strong and very practical. When I wasn’t around, and especially when I was, Bai was the man of the house. She had a tool kit and she could mend things. She was the only of us who could reliably get a good fire going - which included stomping out to the woods, chopping apart dead trees and bringing back the logs.

None of which is to say she wasn’t studious. Of course, actually going to university would always have been too difficult, but instead, she quietly toiled away at a Theology and World Religion degree at the Open University.

She was outward looking, followed politics and helped the Brompton to fundraise. A few years ago, under threat of cut or closure, she wrote a searingly eloquent open letter to MPs, ministers and the press defending the hospital.

She also used her natural connection with children for good. She had a real knack of getting across to them, and they loved her for it. She worked for a while with the charity Time for Children, helping pupils in disadvantaged areas who needed extra support.

## Her strength

Bai was our big sister, even to me, really, and she was the hub of the family. Caite described her as our air traffic controller. She knew where everyone was, what they were doing, and who was in trouble. 

Communication between us flowed through her, like news, requests and urgent calls for advice about the edibility of our chicken. 

Another person might have been central in a family because of the needs of their life-limiting illness. Bai was central in spite of it.

She was one of the strongest and bravest people any of us are ever likely to meet. 

Given the shape of her heart, it was a miracle she made it past six months. It was a miracle she made it past a year. But she did. Then she made it to 5, then 10. And ultimately, to 32. She defied the odds she was given, often apparently through sheer force of personality.

Over time, she gained an aura of invincibility. Every time she went back to the hospital we all knew there were risks, but this was Bai. She’d find a way through. She had already overcome everything and done it with dignity and humour. 

She preferred to live in the moment and hated to feel unaware. She was also tough as nails. After her last major surgery in 2015, she refused morphine, asking instead if the nurse could bring her some paracetamol. 

Often, her strength and fortitude meant that a lot of people around her didn’t really know how serious her condition was, or that time was probably short. She didn’t want to be defined by her heart, but she also wanted to protect us and shield us from it.

I find it astounding to think about the way she lived. Knowing that her body could simply begin to fail, but to not turn inward, get bitter, or give up. Instead, she seized every opportunity and did everything her body would allow.

And beyond that, she kept up the spirits of the people around her. She never let us lose hope, and would tell us off if we began to. And that wasn’t just for her - it was out of genuine care for the rest of us.

The last time I spoke to her, the day after her operation, she was surrounded by a dozen machines, clutching her towel to her chest, struggling to properly wake up. And despite what had just happened to her, she kept on saying sorry - sorry for putting us through it.

That even in the middle of all that - after major open heart surgery - she was still putting other people first, says a very great deal about who she was.

## Bai’s work

In everything she did, Bai was creative. 

From the moment we first got a camcorder, she had been making films. Her love of performing lent itself easily to the stage. At school, she almost stole the show as one of two entirely silent actors in Six Characters in Search of an Author.

She also cared about production values. If a play lacked a costume budget, instead of making do, she’d cut up old fabric and curtains, and stitch them together herself.

But it was in writing that her brilliance shone the brightest. She could write hilarious monologues, engaging dialogue and passionate speeches. Her words were sharp and witty and worked just as well on screen, on stage and on the page.

She preferred to write comedy, but it never lacked depth. That was just as true in her Regency comedy - one of her true passions. One of my favourites was her Regency retelling of the TV series Lost, titled Perilously Unable to Find our Bearings. It was told in the form of an exchange of letters between two sisters and somehow fused a modern-day drama with Pride and Prejudice. 

Over the years, she worked with dozens of passionate people on plays in Cuckfield, Warninglid, Lewes Little Theatre and Players in the Park, and she made films with Octopus, as well as many, many other collaborations.

These were formative experiences for her, and after each success, she grew in confidence, to the point that she was eventually brave enough to be the director. She also successfully submitted her plays to be published and won two awards including Best New Play.

In her work, Bai was diligent and prolific. Most days, she would set herself up at her desk and churn out page after page. She was extremely self-critical, which meant only her absolute best work saw the light of day. In the closest thing she wrote to a will, she said ‘I have already handed over the scripts which I would want to be used or laughed over. Notebooks are to be burned. You have all lived under the illusion that I am a good writer, please let’s keep it that way.’

Most of us suffer from this to an extent: but Bai really struggled to see herself as others did. Her impact on the world was bigger than she realised and her talent was greater than she ever really accepted. 

The Single Takes show that Octopus put on in September was one of those precious times when she simply could not refuse to be proud of herself. For those of you who weren’t there, it was a real high point. The films showcased her ability to write, direct, produce, act and even be the boom operator.

She absolutely sparkled that night.

## The gap she leaves

Bai leaves an unbearably large gap in our lives, and her story wasn’t finished. It seems impossible to do her justice, except in the very broadest strokes. But she leaves a real legacy. A tangible body of work. Stories, plays and films that we can revisit and that will delight us, make us laugh and give us inspiration.

She made a lasting impact on the people and animals in her life, and we take such a lot of comfort being surrounded by people who loved her and cared about her. It’s also so nice to see people that reflect all the different aspects of her life and her being.

## Film and close

In a moment, we’d like to show a short film Bai made, called I Left Early. She made it last year with her Octopus group, and it was screened at their Single Takes show. Although it’s a fictional film, it is very closely based on a letter she wrote to us before her operation in 2015, just in case. 

It is a difficult watch in normal circumstances, and an especially difficult one now. But we think she wouldn’t have made it if she didn’t want us to watch it. It’s a kind of beautiful conversation and is full of truth. It shows some of the best of her: her wit, thoughtfulness, writing and acting ability, and the way even facing horrendous adversity she thought first the people around her.

Thank you.
